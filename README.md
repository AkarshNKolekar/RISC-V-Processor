Just a bunch of modules I've coded up using Verilog in my spare time to keep learning topics I don't deal with at work.
I've been doing this course from [QuickSilicon](https://quicksilicon.in/) on [RISC-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) processor design. There's a bunch of labs they have on it. Most of the code uploaded right now is from the labs I've completed.
